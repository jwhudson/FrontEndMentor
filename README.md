## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Blazor WASM](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
- [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com)

### What I learned

This was a good project for making use of flexbox and thinking about the structure of the HTML which allowed for the most straightforward implemtation of the styling necessary.

### Continued development

This project was a strong starting point for a series of planned porjects which allowed me to brush up on my CSS skills and also practice using bootstrap for quickly laying out a component. Looking forward to adding additional projects and implementing the components in this Blazor project going forward.
